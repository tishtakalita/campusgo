# AMRITA UNIVERSITY AIE C SECTION DATABASE SETUP

This document provides complete SQL scripts to replace your existing CampusGo database with Amrita University AIE C section specific data.

## üìÅ Files Overview

### 1. `amrita_aie_c_section_data.sql` (MAIN FILE)
**Primary script that sets up the complete AIE C section database**
- Clears all existing data
- Creates Amrita University departments (AIE, CSE, AID)
- Adds faculty with proper Amrita email format (`a_name@cb.amrita.edu`)
- Creates all 8 AIE C section courses with proper faculty assignments
- Adds first 20 students (cb.sc.u4aie23201 to cb.sc.u4aie23220)
- Creates classes based on your provided timetable
- Sets up enrollments and user preferences

### 2. `complete_60_students.sql`
**Extends the main script with remaining 40 students**
- Adds students cb.sc.u4aie23221 to cb.sc.u4aie23260
- Follows same naming convention and email format
- Includes partial enrollment examples

### 3. `generate_enrollments.py`
**Python script that generates complete enrollment SQL**
- Creates enrollment records for all 60 students
- Each student enrolled in all 8 courses
- Generates sequential UUIDs for all records

### 4. `remaining_enrollments.sql` (GENERATED)
**Complete enrollment SQL for all remaining students**
- Generated by the Python script
- Contains enrollments for students 203-260
- Ready to execute after main scripts

  - `aie` - Department code (AIE)
  - `23` - Year (2023 batch = 3rd year)
  - `252` - Section + Roll: `2` (C section) + `52` (roll number)

## üìß Email Format

All emails follow Amrita University format:
- **Students**: `cb.sc.u4aie23252@cb.students.amrita.edu`
- **Faculty**: `a_milton@cb.amrita.edu`

## üóìÔ∏è Timetable Integration

Classes are created based on your provided `aie_c_timetable.csv`:
- All time slots mapped correctly
- Room assignments included
- Recurring weekly schedule
- Lab sessions included

## üöÄ Execution Order

**IMPORTANT**: Run these scripts in the exact order shown:

```sql
-- Step 1: Main setup (REQUIRED)
\i amrita_aie_c_section_data.sql

-- Step 2: Add remaining students (REQUIRED)
\i complete_60_students.sql

-- Step 3: Generate complete enrollments
python generate_enrollments.py > complete_enrollments.sql

-- Step 4: Execute complete enrollments (REQUIRED)
\i complete_enrollments.sql
```

## üìä Expected Results

After running all scripts:
- **Students**: 60 (cb.sc.u4aie23201 to cb.sc.u4aie23260)
- **Faculty**: 8 (with proper Amrita emails)
- **Courses**: 8 (all AIE C section courses)
- **Classes**: ~25-30 (based on timetable)
- **Enrollments**: 480 (60 students √ó 8 courses)
- **Departments**: 3 (AIE, CSE, AID)

## ‚úÖ Verification Queries

Run these after execution to verify:

```sql
-- Check students count
SELECT COUNT(*) as total_students FROM users WHERE role = 'student';
-- Expected: 60

-- Check enrollments count  
SELECT COUNT(*) as total_enrollments FROM enrollments;
-- Expected: 480

-- Check students per course
SELECT c.name, COUNT(e.id) as student_count 
FROM courses c 
LEFT JOIN enrollments e ON c.id = e.course_id 
GROUP BY c.id, c.name;
-- Expected: 60 students per course

-- Check student ID format
SELECT student_id, email FROM users WHERE role = 'student' ORDER BY student_id LIMIT 10;
-- Should show: cb.sc.u4aie23201, cb.sc.u4aie23202, etc.

-- Check faculty emails
SELECT email, first_name, last_name FROM users WHERE role = 'faculty';
-- Should show: a_milton@cb.amrita.edu, etc.
```

## üîß Customization Options

You can easily modify:
1. **Add more students**: Follow the pattern in `complete_60_students.sql`
2. **Change year**: Replace `23` with `22`, `24`, etc. throughout
3. **Add other sections**: Change section number `2` to `1` (A section) or `3` (B section)
4. **Different departments**: Replace `aie` with `cse` or `aid`

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

1. **Backup your database** before running these scripts
2. All scripts use `TRUNCATE CASCADE` - this will delete ALL existing data
3. UUIDs are generated in a predictable pattern for consistency
4. All students are set to 3rd year (year_of_study = 3) for 2023 batch
5. Academic year is set to 2025-2026 (current)
6. All data uses proper Indian timezone (Asia/Kolkata)

## üé® Data Features

- **Realistic names**: Mix of Indian first and last names
- **Varied GPAs**: Range from 3.65 to 3.95 (realistic for good students)
- **Appropriate credits**: 85-90 credits for 3rd year students
- **Theme preferences**: Mix of dark/light themes
- **Comprehensive bios**: Each student has AI/ML related specialization

## üìû Support

If you need modifications or encounter issues:
1. Check the verification queries first
2. Ensure scripts are run in the correct order
3. Verify your database schema matches the expected structure
4. All foreign key relationships are properly maintained

The data is now properly formatted for Amrita University AIE C section with realistic academic data!
