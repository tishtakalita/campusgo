I'll analyze the schema, UI components, and create comprehensive API endpoints for your project. Let me start by examining the database schema and UI components systematically.

Now let me examine the UI components to understand what endpoints are needed:

Let me examine more key UI components to understand all the data requirements:

Read [](file:///c%3A/Users/sanmi/Desktop/projects/dbms/aie_portal/Student%20Platform_UI%20Design/src/components/Ideas.tsx#1-1), lines 1 to 100

Now let me examine the complete database schema to understand all existing tables: 

Read [](file:///c%3A/Users/sanmi/Desktop/projects/dbms/aie_portal/supabase_setup.sql#200-200), lines 200 to 280

DELETE /api/batch/files               # Bulk file operations
```

These endpoints cover ALL the UI components you have:
- **Header** (user info, notifications)
- **CurrentClass** (current session data)
- **AssignmentCard** (assignments data)
- **QuickAccess** (shortcuts and quick actions)
- **Timetable** (class schedule)
- **Resources** (course materials)
- **AIChat** (AI conversations)
- **Profile** (user profile and stats)
- **Notifications** (system notifications)
- **Search** (global search functionality)
- **Projects** (project management)
- **Files** (file management)
- **Ideas** (notes and ideas)
- **BottomNav** (navigation state)

Each endpoint is designed to be RESTful and scalable, supporting the exact data structures shown in your UI components and database schema.
I need to thoroughly examine every single UI component to ensure I capture ALL data requirements. Let me systematically go through each component file to double-check and extract any missing endpoints.

Let me check the UI folder for any additional components:

Starting (5/6) *Cross-reference database schema*

Now let me cross-reference the database schema to ensure I haven't missed any tables that need API endpoints:

From the database schema, I can see these tables that need API coverage:
1. ✅ **departments** - covered
2. ✅ **users** - covered  
3. ✅ **courses** - covered
4. ✅ **classes** - covered
5. ✅ **assignments** - covered
6. ✅ **resources** - covered
7. ✅ **enrollments** - covered
8. ✅ **assignment_submissions** - covered
9. ✅ **notifications** - covered
10. ✅ **resource_downloads** - covered
11. ✅ **projects** - covered
12. ✅ **project_members** - covered
13. ✅ **files** - covered
14. ✅ **ideas** - covered
15. ✅ **ai_conversations** - covered
16. ✅ **ai_messages** - covered
17. ✅ **user_preferences** - covered
18. ✅ **current_sessions** - covered

Let me also check if there are any special features in the UI that might need additional endpoints by examining some more details in the components: 

Searched text for `bookmark|favorite|like|share|tag|filter|sort|export|import|download|upload` (`**/Student Platform_UI Design/src/components/*.tsx`), 20 results

Searched text for `progress|percentage|stats|analytics|dashboard|overview` (`**/Student Platform_UI Design/src/components/*.tsx`), 17 results

Let me also check for any special features like attendance, grading, or calendar events: 

Searched text for `grade|attendance|calendar|event|session|live|status|due|deadline` (`**/Student Platform_UI Design/src/components/*.tsx`), 20 results

Starting (6/6) *Compile comprehensive endpoint list*

Now let me compile the FINAL COMPREHENSIVE list of ALL API endpoints after thoroughly analyzing every component:
